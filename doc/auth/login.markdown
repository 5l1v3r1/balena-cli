# login

Use this command to login to your resin.io account.
You need to login before you can use most of the commands this tool provides.

You can pass your credentials as `--username` and `--password` options, or you can omit the
credentials, in which case the tool will present you with an interactive login form.

Examples:

	$ resin login --username <username> --password <password>
	$ resin login

## Options

### --username, -u &#60;username&#62;

user name

### --password, -p &#60;password&#62;

user password
